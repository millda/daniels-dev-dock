# Personalized Developer Environment

A consistent developer environment with all my preferred tools and configurations to simplify working between many computers.


## Basic Use

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/milldr/daniels-dev-dock.git`
2. Run the shell script: `./start.sh`
3. Code away :nerd_face:

The start script will create a shared directory under `~/development_backup` and save all work there.
